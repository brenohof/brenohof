## About me

Since I joined UFU at 2018 my journey in developer's world started.

First I learned about algorithms and data structure putting into practice using C.

After that, I studied about computer architecture, operating systems and computer networks.

Then I started studying about web development.

I am currently participating in programming marathons and studying devops because of my job at zup.
